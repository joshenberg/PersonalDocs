Some personal documents for anyone's viewing (and hiring!) pleasure

Bio:
Young software engineer from Philadelphia, PA (but having lived all across the US).
Currently attending University of Vermont to earn a Bachelor's Degree in CS with minors in Biology and English.

Currently engaged in research with Professor Byung Lee at UVM, sponsored by Vermont Agency of Transportation, testing the efficacy of
utilizing RFID tags on road signs in order to pick up road sign information using a high-gain circular antenna and reader in a passing
motor-vehicle at speeds of up to 70 mph.
My role is writing middleware connecting the antenna with the tag-logging suite on the reader running a headless version of Debian
as well as performing vehicular trials and unit testing. 

Former Software Engineer intern at SelfieCause LLC, a now-defunct Burlington based start-up connecting non-profit donation campaigns
with their corporate sponsors, for the benefit of a. corporations getting tax write-offs for support and b. users getting 
free swag just for donating to their favorite 'cause'.
Spent 1 month on their Android team implementing Google APIs and 1 month leading the UI/UX team in designing interfaces and analytics
suites for both users and non-profit campaigns.

I am an avid outdoorsman and highly-trained SCUBA diver with a penchant for good books and complex board games. I am currently trying 
to model the game Dominion using graph theory so I can get a strategic leg up on my girlfriend.

In my free time, I work as an After-School teacher at a lower-income elementary school, teaching Minecraft,
Magic the Gathering and other mathy games to my 3rd-5th graders. I began my teaching career with STEM classes for 4th and 5th grade
as a Junior in high school and felt compelled by the direct impact I could create on their futures. After that realization,
it will be no easy task to leave my teaching jobs behind. I hope one day to return to teaching after retirement. 

I also spent the last 3 summers picking up some extra cash as a Lead Adventure Guide at ArborTrek Canoopy Adventures, over in
Smuggler's Notch, VT. The job involved taking groups of 2-20 clients on eco-informational zip-line tours for 2-3 hours at a time
through the Vermont forest canopy, while maintaing the strictest safety standards in a high-risk, high-stress environment. It was
arduous but helped me to develop exceptional communicative skills, as I would spend 6-8 hours a day conversing with, guiding 
and teaching clients of all ages and backgrounds. 

I am also looking to be hired! I am a skilled Object-Oriented programmer with a dual love for complex logic and pleasing clients.
