### Hobbies
As a budding Vermonter, I am an avid hiker. I am too gawky for most winter sports, unfortunately. When I am not in Vermont, I am a certified Master SCUBA diver as well. When I'm not outside, I like reading HackerNews, scouting fashion deals on Reddit, or playing board games with friends.
